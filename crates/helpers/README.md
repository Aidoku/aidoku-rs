# Utilities
Utilities to make coding Aidoku sources less miserable. It is available by enabling the `helpers` feature in the main crate
```toml
aidoku = { git = "https://github.com/Aidoku/aidoku-rs", features = ["helpers"] }
```
After enabling the `helpers` feature, this crate is re-exported under the `aidoku::helpers` namespace.
